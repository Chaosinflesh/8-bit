CPU Specification
=================

Registers:

    0x0-E GENERAL PURPOSE
    0xF $RETURN [Populated whenever an interrupt is triggered]

    $TARGET is set programmatically with the SEL instruction


Instruction Set:

    0x0r    SEL $r  Select which register is $TARGET
    0x1r    LDR $r  Load from the address in $r to $TARGET [*]
    0x2r    STR $r  Store from $TARGET into the address in $r
    0x3r    JR $r   Jump to the address in $r
    0x4r    CP $r   Copy from $TARGET into $r [*]
    0x5r    AND $r  AND $TARGET in place with $r
    0x6r    OR $r   OR $TARGET in place with $r
    0x7r    XOR $r  XOR $TARGET in place with $r
    0x8r    ADD $r  Add $r to $TARGET
    0x9r    SUB $r  Subtract $r from $TARGET
    0xAr    MUL $r  Multiply $TARGET by $r
    0xBr    DIV $r  Divide $TARGET by $r
    0xCi    SHL %i  Shift left %i places
    0xDi    SHR %i  Shift right %i places
    0xEi    SSR %i  Signed shift right %i places
    0xF0    LDN !d  Loads !d into $TARGET [*]
    0xF1    STN !d  Stores $TARGET into the address !d
    0xF2    J !d    Jump to the address !d
    0xF3    JZ !d   Jump to the address !d, if $TARGET is ZERO
    0xF4    JN !d   Jump to the address !d, if $TARGET is NEGATIVE
    0xF5    JC !d   Jump to the address !d, if $TARGET had a CARRY
    0xF6    JV !d   Jump to the address !d, if $TARGET had an OVERFLOW
    0xF7    COM     Complement $TARGET
    0xF8    NEG     2s complement $TARGET
    0xF9    INC     Increment $TARGET
    0xFA    DEC     Decrement $TARGET
    0xFB    CLR     Set $TARGET to 0
    0xFC    UNO     Set $TARGET to 1
    0xFD    NOP     No operations
    0xFE    RST     Reset
    0xFF    HLT     Halt

    Notes:
        $r  4-bit register number
        %i  4-bit unsigned integer
        !d  4-byte data segment
        [*] Clears CARRY and OVERFLOW flags on DESTINATION only

MMIOs:

    This CPU uses memory-mapping to provide access to external peripherals.
    Possible MMIOs could include:
    
    - External peripherals, such as timers and IO hardware
    - Communications channels to other devices
    - Sensors
    - SIMD extension hardware connections
    - Hi-precision external FPU
    - Random number generator
    - Clock
    - Security hardware (e.g. TPM)
    - Communication channels to other CPUs
